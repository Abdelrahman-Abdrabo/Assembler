# Assembler
This is an application to convert from assembly language to hex language. 

In this repo, you will find the source code files for this project that I implemented with my team for a computer architecture project. It is a program to help us convert the assembly code into hex code to use with our processor and you will find the jar file of the final project.

Also attached is the test video link:
